# 7. Security (DevSecOps) & Soft Skills

## Security (DevSecOps)

### Security Foundations

#### Core Security Concepts
- **CIA Triad**:
  - Confidentiality: Preventing unauthorized access
  - Integrity: Ensuring data accuracy and reliability
  - Availability: Systems accessible when needed
- **Defense in Depth**:
  - Multiple security controls
  - Layered protection
  - No single point of failure
- **Principle of Least Privilege**:
  - Minimal access rights
  - Just enough access
  - Just-in-time access
- **Zero Trust Model**:
  - Never trust, always verify
  - Micro-segmentation
  - Continuous validation

#### Threat Modeling
- **STRIDE Methodology**:
  - Spoofing: Impersonating something or someone
  - Tampering: Modifying data or code
  - Repudiation: Denying actions
  - Information Disclosure: Exposing information
  - Denial of Service: Degrading service availability
  - Elevation of Privilege: Gaining unauthorized access
- **Process Steps**:
  1. Identify assets
  2. Create architecture overview
  3. Decompose the application
  4. Identify threats
  5. Document threats

  ```
  +------------+------------+------------+------------+
  | Backlog    | In Progress| Review     | Done       |
  | (No limit) | (WIP: 3)   | (WIP: 2)   |            |
  +------------+------------+------------+------------+
  |            |            |            |            |

  As a web application
  I need a load-balanced environment with auto-scaling
  So that I can handle variable traffic loads reliably
  
  Acceptance Criteria:
  - Load balancer distributes traffic across multiple instances
  - Auto-scaling group maintains 2-5 instances based on CPU load
  - Health checks remove unhealthy instances
  - Deployment doesn't cause downtime
  ```
- **Technical Debt Management**:
  - Regular refactoring sprints
  - "Boy Scout Rule" (leave code better than you found it)
  - Tech debt tracking and prioritization
  - Impact assessment
- **DevOps Metrics in Agile**:
  - Deployment Frequency

  ## Architecture
  ![Architecture Diagram](./docs/images/architecture.png)
  
  ## Installation
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
  cd project
  ./setup.sh
  ```
  
  ## Configuration
  
  | Parameter | Description | Default |
  |-----------|-------------|---------|
  | `PORT`    | Server port | 8080    |
  | `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | info |
  
  ## Troubleshooting
  
  > **Note**: Check logs at `/var/log/app/` for detailed error information.
  
  Common issues:
  
  1. **Connection refused**: Ensure the service is running with `systemctl status app`.
  2. **Permission denied**: Verify file permissions with `ls -la /path/to/file`.
  ```

#### Architecture Documentation
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**:
  ```markdown
  # ADR-001: Use Kubernetes for Container Orchestration
  
  ## Status
  Accepted
  
  ## Context
  We need a container orchestration solution for our microservices architecture.
  We evaluated Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and AWS ECS.
  
  ## Decision
  We will use Kubernetes as our container orchestration platform.
  
  ## Rationale
  - Industry standard with broad adoption
  - Rich ecosystem of tools and extensions
  - Cloud-agnostic (works on AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises)
  - Strong declarative configuration model
  - Robust self-healing capabilities
  
  ## Consequences
  - Higher learning curve for teams
  - Need for Kubernetes expertise
  - More complex initial setup
  - Better long-term scalability and portability
  
  ## Alternatives Considered
  - Docker Swarm: Simpler but less feature-rich
  - AWS ECS: Vendor lock-in but tighter AWS integration
  ```
- **System Diagrams**:
  - C4 Model (Context, Container, Component, Code)
  - Sequence diagrams
  - Network diagrams
  - Data flow diagrams
- **Documentation as Code**:
  - AsciiDoc
  - PlantUML
  - Mermaid.js
  - Sphinx
  - MkDocs
  - Hugo (for documentation sites)

#### Runbooks & Playbooks
- **Incident Response Runbook Template**:
  ```markdown
  # Database Failure Runbook
  
  ## Symptoms
  - Application returns database connection errors
  - High latency in database operations
  - Error logs show database timeouts
  
  ## Prerequisites
  - Access to database monitoring dashboard
  - Admin credentials for database
  - Access to backup system
  
  ## Diagnosis Steps
  1. Check database status:
     ```bash
     systemctl status postgresql
     ```
  2. Check database connection count:
     ```bash
     psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"
     ```
  3. Check disk space:
     ```bash
     df -h /var/lib/postgresql/data
     ```
  
  ## Resolution Steps
  
  ### If database is down
  1. Attempt to restart:
     ```bash
     systemctl restart postgresql
     ```
  2. Check logs for errors:
     ```bash
     journalctl -u postgresql --since "1 hour ago"
     ```
  3. If corruption suspected, initiate recovery from backup:
     ```bash
     # Stop service
     systemctl stop postgresql
     
     # Restore from latest backup
     pg_restore -d postgres /backup/latest.dump
     
     # Start service
     systemctl start postgresql
     ```
  
  ## Escalation
  If unable to resolve within 30 minutes, escalate to:
  1. Primary DBA: Jane Doe (phone: xxx-xxx-xxxx)
  2. Secondary DBA: John Smith (phone: xxx-xxx-xxxx)
  
  ## Prevention
  - Increase monitoring on database connection count
  - Schedule regular database maintenance
  - Review query performance and add indexes
  ```
- **Deployment Playbook**:
  ```markdown
  # Application Deployment Playbook
  
  ## Pre-deployment Checklist
  - [ ] Code reviewed and approved
  - [ ] All tests passing in CI pipeline
  - [ ] Database migrations tested
